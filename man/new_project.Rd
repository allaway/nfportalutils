\description{
Set up a new NF project with wiki, folders, fileview, and permissions.
Most parameters come from a project intake & data sharing plan (DSP) form.
Aside from default folders, folders are tailored for data mentioned in DSP.
The NF-OSI team is hard-coded to be admin in addition to the funder team indicated by \code{funder}.
Since this is intended for actual new projects, it will fail if a same existing project is detected.
}
\details{
After project is created, NF Portal representation requires registration in backend:
\itemize{
\item New study row added to the Portal - Studies table.
\item Project added to Portal - Files scope.
}
}
