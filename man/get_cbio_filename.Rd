\description{
This is called from the wrapper \code{write_cbio_clinical}.
Adapted from https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/genie-erbb2-cbio/blob/develop/create_clinical.R#L411.
Note that of the clinical file types, the PATIENT type can actually be optional,
and we (NF) currently don't use the TIMELINE type, so options have been simplified.
