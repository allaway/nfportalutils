\title{Write cBioPortal clinical file}
\usage{
write_cbio_clinical(
  df,
  ref_map,
  na_recode = c("NA", "NaN", "unknown", "Unknown"),
  delim = "\\t",
  publish_dir = ".",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} representing clinical dataset to publicize.}

\item{ref_map}{YAML or JSON mapping. See details.}

\item{na_recode}{Possible NA values to replace with a blank string (which seems to be standard) in exported file.}

\item{delim}{Delimiter character used for writing file, defaults to tab-delimited per cBioPortal specs.}

\item{publish_dir}{Directory path to write to, defaults to current.}

\item{verbose}{Report where file has been written.}
}
\description{
Wrapper function for creating clinical files. There are two: PATIENT and SAMPLE.
The PATIENT file is actually optional, so there are only checks for making sure SAMPLE can be created.
\code{df} is expected to be a table containing clinical data available, and maybe even some irrelevant data
(since NF data is not well-normalized and there is a single table with everything).
}
\details{
This relies on a \code{ref_map} specification to know which clinical data to include for cBioPortal
and how to segregate the clinical attributes into the right files.
For example, say \code{df} contains clinical variables A-X, but mappings are only specified for
variables A-C, L-M and others are not meant to be surfaced/made public. This will subset the \code{df} to what's specified in the mapping.
Conversely, if there is a mapping for variable Z that is \emph{not} in the clinical data, this \emph{will} throw error.
