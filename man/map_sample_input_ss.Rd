\title{Parse nextflow samplesheet for sample inputs}
\usage{
map_sample_input_ss(
  samplesheet,
  parse_fun = function(x) gsub("_T[0-9]$", "", x)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samplesheet}{A local file or syn id of samplesheet.}

\item{parse_fun}{Function implementing how to parse samples in samplesheet.}
}
\description{
Samplesheets are used in rnaseq pipelines,
and are defined here: https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/usage#full-samplesheet.
After the pipeline is run, it should be found in an output folder called \code{pipeline_info}.
}
\details{
This is a simple helper to get a mapping of sample names to input files
(usually one-to-many but can be one-to-one) to pass to downstream as a table.
