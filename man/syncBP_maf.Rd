\arguments{
\item{merged_maf}{Synapse id of \verb{merged maf} file for public release.}

\item{samplesheet}{Synapse id or local path to samplesheet with release info.}

\item{ref_map}{YAML file specifying the mapping of (NF) clinical metadata to cBioPortal model. See details.}

\item{ref_view}{A view that contains clinical data for the release files.}

\item{cancer_study_identifier}{The study identifier, defaults to \code{nfosi_YEAR}.}

\item{publish_dir}{Where to output the set of files.
Defaults to (creating if necessary) a folder with same name as \code{cancer_study_identifier}.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to provide informative messages throughout.}

\description{
The NF-OSI workflow produces a single merged maf file that represents a filtered subset of the \code{maf}s,
containing only the (non-germline) data that \emph{can} be released for cBioPortal.
However, this data file by itself is not immediately loadable into an instance of a cBioPortal server
and needs to be packaged with other files, such as this
\href{https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub/tree/1e03ea6ab5e0ddd497ecf349cbee7d50aeebcd5e/public/msk_ch_2020}{example of a public mutations dataset}.
This is a wrapper that goes through several steps needed to create said bundle of cBioPortal files more conveniently.

\enumerate{
\item A simple sanity check that this is the version of the maf release file that we want, based on the samplesheet.
For example, version 1 of the samplesheet will generate a version 1 of the merged maf,
but if there is a later correction that retracts a sample (\code{is_releasable}=FALSE),
that step of the workflow to generate merged maf will be rerun (or it should be), so we'll want to make sure the latest versions of these files are used.
The latest versions of the samplesheets tied to each release are currently stored in \code{syn38793855}.
(Note: Please file issue to update this doc if this changes.)
\item Make the clinical data files.
For NF, the clinical metadata are annotations on the files/surfaced in a view and are pretty basic.
In the future, it would be preferable to store clinical metadata in a real normalized table.
For now, this clinical data is pulled in from the view. To map NF clinical variables to the

\href{https://docs.cbioportal.org/file-formats/#custom-columns-in-clinical-data}{as recommended},
this step requires a \code{ref_map}, which is a YAML file.
\item Make meta files. Meta files are needed for describing the study, mutations data file, clinical data files.
